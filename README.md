Software application developed in the context of my MEng Thesis.
	
	Cities have become a cornerstone in socioeconomic development due to the increasing 
	concentration of people in urban areas. More than 70% of people will live in cities in 2050. 
	This increase leads changes in sustainability, efficiency and social progress contextualised 
	under the concept Smart City. This concept gathers initiatives and strategies focused on 
	improving citizens quality of life, sustainability and efficient management of resources, 
	innovating in materials and models with technology as a tool.
	
	This project presents a conceptual solution in the area of environmental sustainability 
	through a deployment of a pollution sensors network. These sensors provide readings from 
	different typologies in order to monitor values of atmospheric gases. Monitoring, management 
	and alerts are performed using FIWARE, an european platform aimed to deliver cloud services.
